# Troubleshooting

## Port Conflicts

**Symptom:** `daemon start` fails with "address already in use"

**Fix:** Another process is using port 3002 (WebSocket) or 3100 (control API). Either stop that process or use
different ports:

```bash
remnote-cli daemon start --ws-port 4002 --control-port 4100
# Then use --control-port for all commands:
remnote-cli status --control-port 4100
```

## Bridge Not Connecting

**Symptom:** `remnote-cli status` shows `connected: false`

**Checklist:**
1. Is RemNote running?
2. Is the RemNote Automation Bridge plugin installed and enabled in RemNote?
3. Give the bridge time to connect automatically in the background after RemNote starts.
4. If you open the Automation Bridge panel in the right sidebar, does it show **Connected**?
5. Is the daemon running on port 3002? (The bridge connects to this port)
6. If RemNote was already open before the daemon started, wait for background retry or click **Reconnect** in the
   panel if you want an immediate retry.
7. Check daemon logs: `remnote-cli daemon start --foreground --log-level debug`

For detailed bridge retry phases and wake-up behavior, see the canonical bridge doc:
[Connection Lifecycle Guide](https://github.com/robert7/remnote-mcp-bridge/blob/main/docs/guides/connection-lifecycle.md).

## Version Mismatch After Upgrade

**Symptom:** `status` may show connected, but commands fail after upgrading the bridge plugin or `remnote-cli`.

**Fix:**
1. Check bridge plugin version in RemNote (or from `status` output if it reports `pluginVersion`).
2. Check CLI version: `remnote-cli --version`.
3. Install a compatible CLI version (prefer same minor line for `0.x`).
4. See the [Bridge / Consumer Version Compatibility Guide](https://github.com/robert7/remnote-mcp-bridge/blob/main/docs/guides/bridge-consumer-version-compatibility.md).

## Daemon Won't Start

**Symptom:** `daemon start` hangs or times out

**Fix:** Try foreground mode to see error output:

```bash
remnote-cli daemon start --foreground --log-level debug
```

Common causes:
- Port already in use (see above)
- Stale PID file — `daemon start` should auto-detect and clean up, but you can manually remove
  `~/.remnote-cli/daemon.pid` if needed

## Daemon Won't Stop

**Symptom:** `daemon stop` reports success but daemon is still running

**Fix:** The daemon has a 3-second graceful shutdown window, then receives SIGTERM. If it still won't stop:

```bash
# Find the PID
cat ~/.remnote-cli/daemon.pid
# Force kill
kill -9 <pid>
# Clean up PID file
rm ~/.remnote-cli/daemon.pid
```

## Command Timeouts

**Symptom:** Commands hang for 5+ seconds then fail with "Request timeout"

**Cause:** The bridge plugin received the request but didn't respond in time. This can happen if RemNote is
busy or the plugin encountered an error. Check RemNote's developer console for plugin errors.

## Argument Shifting / Flag Swallowing

**Symptom:** Command fails with `looks like a flag but was passed as an option value` or `Argument shifting detected`.

**Cause:** The shell misinterpreted your command, likely because an empty string or a missing value caused the *next* flag to be consumed as the value for the *current* option.

Example of problematic syntax:
```bash
# This may fail if the shell treats --content as the value for --title
remnote-cli create --title --content "Note body"
```

**Fix:** Ensure every option that expects a value has one. Use explicit equality syntax to force empty values or avoid ambiguity:
```bash
# Explicit empty title
remnote-cli create --title="" --content "Note body"
```
