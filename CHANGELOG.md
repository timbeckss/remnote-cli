# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Legacy bridge warning**: `status` now injects `version_warning` for legacy bridge plugins (0.5.x) that don't send
  a `hello` message, by falling back to `pluginVersion` from the `get_status` response.
- Integration anchor-note reuse now uses deterministic multi-strategy lookup for
  `RemNote Automation Bridge [temporary integration test data]`:
  multi-query title search (normalized exact match), then anchor-tag lookup (`remnote-integration-root-anchor`), then create.
- Integration setup now backfills the anchor tag on reused title-search matches so subsequent runs resolve deterministically.
- Integration setup now fails early when duplicate exact integration-root titles are detected, printing duplicate `remId`s
  so test data can be cleaned before execution.
- Integration runner startup now logs whether the anchor note was found or created, including selected `remId`.
- Integration `search-tag` scenario now derives expected target from live ancestry traversal of the tagged note
  (nearest document/daily document fallback), avoiding false negatives when RemNote hierarchy returns document ancestors.
- Integration tests now pass an explicit `search --include-content <mode>` value and cover all three modes
  (`markdown`, `structured`, `none`) with response-shape assertions.
- Integration tests now cover `read --include-content` modes (`markdown`, `none`) with response-shape assertions for
  `content` / `contentProperties`.

### Added

- **Automatic version compatibility checks**: Daemon receives bridge `hello` message on connect, stores bridge version,
  and logs a warning if minor versions differ (0.x rule). `status` command output now includes `cliVersion` and
  `version_warning` (when bridge/CLI minor versions differ).
- Integration `Status Check` workflow now fails fast when `status` reports a bridge/CLI `version_warning`.

### Enhanced

- `search` command now supports `--include-content <mode>` with `"markdown"` mode for rendered child subtree previews.
- `search` command now also supports `--include-content structured`, surfacing bridge `contentStructured` results with
  nested child `remId`s in JSON output for follow-up reads/navigation.
- Added `search-tag <tag>` command, dispatching `search_by_tag` with the same content-rendering options as `search`
  (`--include-content`, `--depth`, `--child-limit`, `--max-content-length`).
- `read` command now displays rendered markdown content, aliases, content properties, and type-aware headlines.
- `search --text` now includes parent context suffix when available (`<- parentTitle [parentRemId]`).
- `read --text` now includes a `Parent:` line when parent context is available.
- New options for both commands: `--child-limit`, `--max-content-length`.
- `search` command shows `headline` (with type-aware delimiters) and `aliases` in text output.
- Integration workflows now reuse a shared root-level anchor note
  `RemNote Automation Bridge [temporary integration test data]` and create all test notes under that parent.
- Integration Create & Search workflow now also validates `search-tag` with all three `includeContent`
  modes (`markdown`, `structured`, `none`).

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: `--include-content` changed from boolean flag to string option (`"none"` or `"markdown"`).
- **BREAKING**: `detail` field is no longer expected in `search` / `read` JSON responses from the bridge; text output uses `headline` / `title`.
- Default `--depth` for `read` command increased from 1 to 5.
- Search content preview default depth is now 1 (CLI `search --depth` help/docs aligned).
- `search` text output now uses `headline` field for display when available, with aliases shown as `(aka: ...)` suffix.
- `read` text output restructured: shows headline, type, aliases, card direction, children stats, and rendered content.
- Standardized root shell script bootstrapping so Node-dependent scripts source `node-check.sh` via script-dir paths at startup (including `publish-to-npm.sh`).

### Documentation

- Added bridge/plugin compatibility warnings and install guidance links for `0.x` version matching, referencing the canonical bridge-side compatibility guide.
- Updated command reference defaults/options for `search`/`read` depth and `--include-content <mode>`.
- Updated command reference examples and option docs for `search --include-content structured`.
- Updated command reference and README command tables for new `search-tag` command.
- Updated integration testing guide to document shared integration-anchor reuse behavior and `search-tag` coverage.
- Updated `AGENTS.md` integration-test policy wording to explicitly require manual human execution for integration tests.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- Added `docs/demo.md` with a CLI demo walkthrough and an OpenClaw usage example covering daemon status checks and
  search workflow.

### Changed

- Version advanced from `0.2.0` to `0.5.0` to align with related project versioning in Automation Bridge and MCP
  Server, making bridge contract alignment more visible.
- Increased default search limit from 10 to 50.
- Search text output now shows `remType` as compact prefix (`[doc]`, `[concept]`, `[desc]`, etc.) and `detail` as
  truncated suffix when available.
- Search results no longer include the `preview` field (removed upstream in the bridge plugin contract).
- Updated npm development scripts so `npm run dev` runs the CLI once (no file watching), and added
  `npm run dev:watch` for explicit watch-mode development.
- Updated documentation for the `dev` / `dev:watch` split and added a bridge limitation note that full REM + children
  reads are not yet available.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-18

### Added

- Daemon architecture: background process hosting WebSocket server (:3002) and HTTP control API (:3100).
- WebSocket server for RemNote Automation Bridge plugin connectivity (ported from remnote-mcp-server).
- Daemon lifecycle management: `daemon start`, `daemon stop`, `daemon status` commands.
- PID file tracking at `~/.remnote-cli/daemon.pid` with stale process detection.
- Six bridge commands: `create`, `search`, `read`, `update`, `journal`, `status`.
- JSON output (default, for agentic consumers) and `--text` flag for human-readable output.
- Daemon client (fetch-based HTTP) for CLI-to-daemon communication.
- Pino-based structured logging with optional pino-pretty for TTY.
- Global CLI flags: `--json`, `--text`, `--control-port`, `--verbose`, `--version`.
- Exit codes: 0 (success), 1 (error), 2 (daemon not running), 3 (bridge not connected).
- Integration test suite with 6 workflows (daemon lifecycle, status, create/search, read/update, journal, errors).
- Integration test runner (`run-integration-test.sh`) with interactive confirmation.
- Unit tests for WebSocket server, control server, daemon client, PID utilities, formatter, CLI structure.
- Production dependencies: `ws`, `pino`.
- Dev dependencies: `@types/ws`, `pino-pretty`.
- Architecture documentation (`docs/architecture.md`).
- User guides: installation, daemon management, command reference, integration testing, development setup,
  troubleshooting.
- Updated README with architecture diagram, quick start, command reference, and troubleshooting.
- ExecPlan for daemon implementation (`.agents/execplans/cli-daemon-implementation.md`).

### Changed

- Rewrote `src/cli.ts` from hello-world to full Commander.js program with subcommands and global options.
- Updated `README.md` with a dedicated Documentation section that links all guides under `docs/guides/`.
- Updated `AGENTS.md` to reflect current daemon-based architecture and implemented command/test scope.
- Updated integration tests to require a pre-running daemon (no test-managed daemon start/stop lifecycle).
- Updated integration testing guide to document external daemon prerequisite and revised workflow order.
- Fixed CLI `status` bridge action name to `get_status` for compatibility with current RemNote Automation Bridge plugin.
- Added unit coverage to prevent regressions in status action dispatch.
- Fixed CLI bridge action mappings for `create`, `read`, `update`, and `journal` to use bridge-compatible snake_case names.
- Fixed `update` payload mapping to send `appendContent` for `--append`.
- Added unit coverage for command-to-bridge action and payload mapping.
- Updated `AGENTS.md` with a no-AI-integration-test policy and prominent companion-project context paths.
- Updated `AGENTS.md` companion-project references to sibling-relative `$(pwd)/../...` paths with short project-purpose notes.
- Added terminology aliases in `AGENTS.md` to clarify project name equivalence (MCP server/bridge and companion naming).
- Added status/license/CI/codecov badges at the top of `README.md` to align with companion repository conventions.
- Updated README top description to use the current bridge name and link to `remnote-mcp-bridge`.
