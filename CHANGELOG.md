# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added OpenClaw skill docs under `openclaw-skill/`:
  - `openclaw-skill/remnote/SKILL.md` with read-first defaults, strict `confirm write` gating for mutating commands,
    bridge/CLI `0.x` compatibility checks, example trigger phrases for OpenClaw auto-activation, and blue `🌀` emoji.
  - `openclaw-skill/README.md` with repository-facing overview of the skill package.

### Changed

- Expanded `docs/guides/command-reference.md` to fully document daemon subcommands, global flags, option defaults,
  option-interaction rules, exit codes, and representative usage patterns for automation consumers.
- Rewrote `AGENTS.md` as a concise repo map and aligned it to the shared cross-repo section template, matching current
  daemon command/contract guidance and removing stale or contradictory instruction detail.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-25

### Added

- `status` now includes `cliVersion` and `version_warning`, using bridge `hello` handshake tracking to surface
  bridge/CLI 0.x minor-version mismatches.
- Added `search-tag <tag>`, dispatching `search_by_tag` with the same content controls as `search`
  (`--include-content`, `--depth`, `--child-limit`, `--max-content-length`).
- `search` now supports `--include-content structured`, exposing bridge `contentStructured` results in JSON output.
- `search --text` and `read --text` now show parent context when available.

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: `--include-content` changed from boolean flag to string mode (`none`, `markdown`, `structured`).
- **BREAKING**: CLI no longer expects bridge `detail` in `search`/`read` JSON responses; text output now uses
  `headline`/`title`.
- Default `read` depth increased to 5, and both `search`/`read` now support `--child-limit` and
  `--max-content-length`.
- `read --text` output was restructured to include headline/type/aliases/card-direction/content metadata.

### Fixed

- `status` now reports compatibility warnings for legacy 0.5.x bridge plugins that do not send `hello`, by falling
  back to `pluginVersion` from `get_status`.
- Improved stability of search/read mode handling in test automation (mode-specific response-shape assertions).

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- Added `docs/demo.md` with a CLI demo walkthrough and an OpenClaw usage example covering daemon status checks and
  search workflow.

### Changed

- Version advanced from `0.2.0` to `0.5.0` to align with related project versioning in Automation Bridge and MCP
  Server, making bridge contract alignment more visible.
- Increased default search limit from 10 to 50.
- Search text output now shows `remType` as compact prefix (`[doc]`, `[concept]`, `[desc]`, etc.) and `detail` as
  truncated suffix when available.
- Search results no longer include the `preview` field (removed upstream in the bridge plugin contract).
- Updated npm development scripts so `npm run dev` runs the CLI once (no file watching), and added
  `npm run dev:watch` for explicit watch-mode development.
- Updated documentation for the `dev` / `dev:watch` split and added a bridge limitation note that full REM + children
  reads are not yet available.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-18

### Added

- Daemon architecture: background process hosting WebSocket server (:3002) and HTTP control API (:3100).
- WebSocket server for RemNote Automation Bridge plugin connectivity (ported from remnote-mcp-server).
- Daemon lifecycle management: `daemon start`, `daemon stop`, `daemon status` commands.
- PID file tracking at `~/.remnote-cli/daemon.pid` with stale process detection.
- Six bridge commands: `create`, `search`, `read`, `update`, `journal`, `status`.
- JSON output (default, for agentic consumers) and `--text` flag for human-readable output.
- Daemon client (fetch-based HTTP) for CLI-to-daemon communication.
- Pino-based structured logging with optional pino-pretty for TTY.
- Global CLI flags: `--json`, `--text`, `--control-port`, `--verbose`, `--version`.
- Exit codes: 0 (success), 1 (error), 2 (daemon not running), 3 (bridge not connected).
- Integration test suite with 6 workflows (daemon lifecycle, status, create/search, read/update, journal, errors).
- Integration test runner (`run-integration-test.sh`) with interactive confirmation.
- Unit tests for WebSocket server, control server, daemon client, PID utilities, formatter, CLI structure.
- Production dependencies: `ws`, `pino`.
- Dev dependencies: `@types/ws`, `pino-pretty`.
- Architecture documentation (`docs/architecture.md`).
- User guides: installation, daemon management, command reference, integration testing, development setup,
  troubleshooting.
- Updated README with architecture diagram, quick start, command reference, and troubleshooting.
- ExecPlan for daemon implementation (`.agents/execplans/cli-daemon-implementation.md`).

### Changed

- Rewrote `src/cli.ts` from hello-world to full Commander.js program with subcommands and global options.
- Updated `README.md` with a dedicated Documentation section that links all guides under `docs/guides/`.
- Updated `AGENTS.md` to reflect current daemon-based architecture and implemented command/test scope.
- Updated integration tests to require a pre-running daemon (no test-managed daemon start/stop lifecycle).
- Updated integration testing guide to document external daemon prerequisite and revised workflow order.
- Fixed CLI `status` bridge action name to `get_status` for compatibility with current RemNote Automation Bridge plugin.
- Added unit coverage to prevent regressions in status action dispatch.
- Fixed CLI bridge action mappings for `create`, `read`, `update`, and `journal` to use bridge-compatible snake_case names.
- Fixed `update` payload mapping to send `appendContent` for `--append`.
- Added unit coverage for command-to-bridge action and payload mapping.
- Updated `AGENTS.md` with a no-AI-integration-test policy and prominent companion-project context paths.
- Updated `AGENTS.md` companion-project references to sibling-relative `$(pwd)/../...` paths with short project-purpose notes.
- Added terminology aliases in `AGENTS.md` to clarify project name equivalence (MCP server/bridge and companion naming).
- Added status/license/CI/codecov badges at the top of `README.md` to align with companion repository conventions.
- Updated README top description to use the current bridge name and link to `remnote-mcp-bridge`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-18

### Added

- Initial bootstrap for `remnote-cli` npm package.
- TypeScript-based executable CLI with hello-world command output.
- Project tooling scripts: `node-check.sh`, `code-quality.sh`, `publish-to-npm.sh`.
- Initial repository metadata and packaging configuration for npm publication.
- Basic Vitest test suite (`test/setup.ts`, `test/unit/cli.test.ts`) and coverage config.
- GitHub Actions CI workflow to run code quality checks and tests on push/PR.
- Agent collaboration scaffolding copied from `remnote-mcp-server` (`.agents/*` with empty `.agents/execplans/`).
